* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

W3school.com - I used it to get the list of colors supported by HTML and alignment terms to align the buttons in the center of the screen

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One of the biggest challenges in creating the submission was both the layout and creating the GIFs. The layout was difficult because I donâ€™t know all of the options available to me and what values I can enter. I solved this problem with W3Schools.com which I found had a large database of what objects can use what layouts and what values can be entered. This was helpful specifically when I was attempting to get the buttons to be in two rows centered in the middle of the screen and not in one large row. I also had trouble creating the GIFs for the README document. I was using Recordit and every time I hit the create GIF button it would get stuck loading forever. I solved this problem because I realized that I was recording a 4k screen, so the file was too large for Recordit to process in a normal amount of time. I fixed this by reducing my screen resolution to 1080p and making my recordings shorter. This solved the loading problem, and I was able to quickly and easily get my GIFs. It also had the benefit of making my mouse cursor slightly larger which makes it easier to see where I am clicking.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Some of the questions I have about web development after completing my solution would be: How would you create a more complex site with multiple pages?, What is the best way to design a web layout, what would be the most user friendly?, How do you efficiently collaborate on a website? I have worked with others before creating a website but we ran into a couple problems with getting everyone the most up to date code. How do you integrate a backend into a website? Like a stored data set or a server.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would add and optional endless mode with a score tally. This would remove the win notification and replace it with only a lose notification but with their score on it. I would also display the players score as they went. I would also refactor the sounds of the buttons. I prefer the flat tones that they play currently but I would research the AudioContext library more and remove the volume wave that happens so that the tones are always played at a constant volume. I would add a toggle switch that would change whether or not the game sped up or not. I currently have the game speed up but I would add and option to turn that off. Lastly I would change the regular mode to have three lives and add a hard mode which increases the length of the pattern and one life.
